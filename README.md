# Hi! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Nice to see you here.

My name is Rafael Feiten and I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer.
In my leisure time I like to watch movies and series, read books that improve me as a person and stay with my family. I love to learn new things and apply them in my daily life/work. I graduated in Information Systems in 2020 and I try to keep learning new things every day.
